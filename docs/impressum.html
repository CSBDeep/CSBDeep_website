						<p>As the provider of contents in accordance with Section 7 Paragraph 1 of the Tele-Media Law, the Max Planck Society shall be responsible for any contents which it makes available for use in accordance with general legal provisions.

The Max Planck Society expressly dissociates itself from such contents.  </p>
